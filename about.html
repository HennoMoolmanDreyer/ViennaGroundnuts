                                    Story; started1997, mainly produced cash crops like maize, sunflower and groundnuts. Also sheep and cattle farming. From 2014 we started with the processing of groundnuts and cleaning of othet grains, in 2019 we formed a joint venture with RobaFoods. 
                                    In 2016 we realized that our sustainability in terms of soil health lacks, so we started with the making of compost and vermicompost to be used on grain feilds. We had some setbacks in terms of dtought, late rains and made some mistakes on our (not yet finished) journey to regenerative agriculture.
                                    Fundamentals; to build good relationships with clients, have high integrity/ethics and buil a business that is ressiliant.
